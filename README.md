### Difficulties and explain

Start to write down the text in gross, following the instruction givin by my coach.

First difficult come for the CSS, I forget the magical "margin: auto;"
A lot of tiny difficulties but not really hard for reach the final of exercice.

Another problem encounterd is I don't use many tag div so my code is not divised as many as I need.

Thanks to Corentin for some help.
